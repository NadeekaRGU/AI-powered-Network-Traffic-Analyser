# AI-powered-Network-Traffic-Analyser
This is a prototype of AI-powered traffic analyser for IoT networks.

This application uses a binary classifier in the backend to analyse the network traffic and classify it as benign or malicious. A dashboard is created using streamlit-python to visualise analysed data in the front end. 
When the model identifies malicious traffic, the information related to that record is displayed on the dashboard.
